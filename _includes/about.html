                    <p>I started my career developing products for edtech in 2003.<br>After that, I worked on a knowledge management platform to support SOX compliance. The results drove national aviation regulatory changes.
                    <br>For the past five years I've been working with product and business development. I graduated in Class 1 of Startup Chile with my first company, in HR tech, and also led a Silicon Valley startup entry strategy in Latin America.<br> Then I joined a 3D printing startup founding team. The company focus on very interesting pain points of the industry, and our work and thought leadership have earned us strong reputation and media attention.</p>

                    <p>I currently work for an edtech startup in Silicon Valley helping school district manage change and experiment with new instructional models.<br>
                    I like cooking, running, reading, sewing, sun bathing, Python, silence, hiking and yoga. I pray because I'm helpless. I volunteer because it helps me while (and maybe more than) I help other people.<br>
                    I should get a dog.
