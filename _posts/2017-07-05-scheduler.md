The post scheduler helps GDI SF promote its workshops on Twitter. The app reads a Google Spreadsheet, selects the valid ones, chooses a random tweet, and post it to Twitter, with a photo, on a regular interval.

I started at [GDI SF](http://meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/) as a student in 2015, then as a TA after that. In 2017 I became Chapter Leader and, with other 3 amazing ladies, help women get started with coding.
