Authentiseâ€™s print monitoring tool uses an off-the-shelf webcam to monitor your print progress with cutting-edge computer vision. If it detects a deviation from the intended build progress, you will be informed by email or text. You can also pause your print remotely and address the failure later saving time and material. The product is currently being deployed to industrial printers and merging to [3Diax](http://3diax.com) as the Monitoring module of the platform.
